      due to missing return call introduced in rc2.
 (SM) SSL clients that are FLined and joining when server is full will now correctly
      be able to connect. (#0000037)
 (SM) Non SSL clients can no longer be invited into +S channels and

 (PH) Fixed bug #0000027 causing both QUIT and PART to be seen under some circumstances.
 (SM) Moved source repository from SourceForge CVS over to a Subversion server. 


rc1
 (BP) Fixed entropy generation on OpenBSD and cleaned up status messages (from Mark19960)

 (SM) EOBURST added to allow the servers network wide to be aware of when a server is fully
      synched to the network. This also allows us to generate global (Far) connect notices
      locally. Once the entire network is running RC1 or higher you may safely change
      "global_connects" to 0 in your networks settings file. RC1 will happily propogate
      global connect notices for older versions.
 (SM) Fix a legacy TS issue in m_nick negotiation. Fix taken from Bahamut, originally from Hybrid.


beta3
 (SM) Fixed a bug on +M channels where +r was removed before the error checks on if

      This to address an issue with some clients being confused by the second
      string of modes.
      Reported and patched by DaPrivateer @ Irchighway.net
 (SM) Really fix Channelmode +A and +O permissions. (#0000026)
 (SM) Allow ULined servers to set channelmode +S.

 (SM) OpenSSL is now correctly detected and used on systems
      with custom OpenSSL paths.
 (SM) IPv6 support is now enabled using --enable-ipv6 for configure.

      This WILL cause problems if you try to run on a network with
      older versions than at least a26, preferably you should never mix
      with anything older than the last released development release.
 (SM) Oper up notices now report the correct OLine flags.
      Reported by several.
 (SM) Fixed send_lusers whining about invisible user count being off.
      Reported by several.
      Tested and patched by K. Hawkes (k dot hawkes at zombies dot force9 dot net)
 (SM) Now give off warnings when a bogus akill is recieved to alert online staff
      that their AKILL system is sending out bad AKILL's.
 (BP) Rewrite of the main IO loop.
 (BP) New socket engine with support for select, poll and kqueue.
 (BP) Fix bug preventing KLines/AKills on xxx.xxx.xxx.x* IP masks.
 (SM) Reworked the compile/install process. The IRCd will by default be installed in
      ~/UltimateIRCd when you issue make install. Please note, if you do not use
      make install you will now have to install the IRCd manually according to the
      paths given to configure.
 (AA) You should now be able to link an IPv6 enabled server to an Non IPv6 enabled server.
 (AA) SETHOST's issued by opers are now announced network wide.
 (SM) Fixed a possible desynch with +nt modes on channels.
 (SM) Corrected permission checking for +O and +A channel modes.
      Reported by K. Hawkes (k dot hawkes at zombies dot force9 dot net)
 (SM) Main services aliases now /CS, /NS, /MS, /BS etc. Long aliases keept for
      compactibility.
 (SM) Max clients are now set using the --with-maxclients= parameter for configure.
 (BP) Do not send server already exsist notices to operators for servers that
      appear to be juped.
 (AA) Added /hs and /hostserv aliases as well as the facility to set an hostserv name.
 (SM) Ported SVSJOIN from 2.8.x.
 (JH) Fixed an issue when compiling with SSL on RedHat 9.
 (SM) Added Chinese Nickname support. Code provided by laowang @ SRC Forums.
      As i have no way to test this its entirely unsupported and i only have
      laowang's word that it functions.
 (AA) IPv4 servers are now able to handle IPv6.
 (AA) Its not longer possible to change the same mode multiple times for the same target.
      (within the same mode change) Except for (Ulined) Servers.
 (AA) Added /stats x support. Stats x will show all missing links where the server
      has C/N lines to.
 (AA) Akills are now working again. (for ipv6)
 (AA) IPv6 is ready for public use. Its tested but keep your eyes open for bugs.
      For the services coders out there:
      To support Ultimate3 with IPv6 you should support Client. If you announce
      your services to be IPv6 Capable they will get the IP's plain. Which
      should be easy to handle. If you have any questions throw an email at me.
 (JH) Cleaned up the include file hell so that Ultimate can compile with
      -Wall. There are still a few outstanding warnings that need to be
      looked into with -pedantic though
 (SM) Fixed channel QLines.
      Reported by Mortalica & Fizzwizz @ SRC Forum.
 (QN) Added 'set_oper_access' sub-routine to deal with oper access flags,
      setting of hostmasks and such, all stuff that used to be in m_oper.
 (QN) Added 'make_opervirthost_acc' to accompany above routine.
 (QN) Patched opermotd bug that showed a non-existant date if no oper-motd had ever been created.
 (QN) Patched same bug as above, but with 'motd' too.
 (SM) Added /CHANFIX to allow Administrators to resynch the timestamp on channels
      who for one reason or another have had their timestamp set to an invalid value.
      /CHANFIX <channelname>
 (SM) Added usermode +d (deaf client) to which allows bots to be deaf to channel traffic.
 (SM) Added NMODE (Notice Mode) to replace several old user modes.
      See /IRCDHELP NMODES and /IRCDHELP NMODE for details.
 (SM) Ported usermode +R from bahamut-release to disallow non registered users to send private messages.
 (SM) Ported channelmode +M from bahamut-release to disallow non registered users to send messages to channel.
 (SM) Added missing error check for port in MLine.
 (QN) Fixed opermotd, rules, motd, shortmotd and help corruption issues.
 (SM) Added channelmode +q to allow channels to supress QUIT and PART messages.
      This has the side effect of causing the client to always part a channel when issuing QUIT, but it does
      disallow spam in PART and QUIT
 (AA) Opers who go /away dont lose +h. But they are not shown as "available for help"
      as long as they stay away. (fix for +h not getting set after unaway)
 (AA) Added additional error checking to the m_del* commands.
      This hopefully fixes the the config file corruption if the ircd is out
      of disksapce.

 (BP) Bugfix for kqueue engine.
 (SM) OpenSSL now defaults to off.
 (SM) Non Channel Staff who try to view the banlist will now recieve an empty banlist instead of an error message
      as most clients automatically try to fetch the banlist upon joining a channel.
 (SM) Fixed crash introduced by some of the cleanups carried out a while ago by Fish (#0000020)
 (SM) Fixed an issue with ircsprintf family under x86_64. Many thanx to David Ranger for helping
      me track this problem down and for providing a fix for it.

      Non opers where able to set themselves +h, +F, +k, +g
      under some circumstances.
      Reported by JH.
 (SM) DRONE protection now have the warnings disabled by default
      using a define in config.h.
      When defined it will only send warnings to local opers.
      Network wide warnings are still sent when the actual protection is triggered.
 (SM) /LUSERS will no longer count ULined clients at all towards network max or online operators.

 (SM) Added network settings option to disallow users from going -x on the network. (mode_x_lock).
 (SM) Version mismatches in the ircd.ini and network settings files are no longer fatal
      and error checking will take care of setting missing values to default.
 (SM) Fixed a bug allowing non opers to set +F.


alpha27
 (SM) IMPORTANT
      U and H line format have been altered:
      U:Server Name:*:*::

 (SM) Walk the fdlist backwards in m_akill, m_kline and m_szline to prevent double
      calling exit_client for the same client where exit_client have not yet been able
      to modify the fdlist index. Thanx Agy :)
 (SM) Added J-Lines which will be used to define which nicknames may preform remote
      commands on other servers.
      Format: J:*::nickname::
      The nickname will need to be registered and identified with services in order to be allowed
      to issue commands. (Not used for anything yet. Will be used for remote rehash etc)
 (SM) Added ClientSSL thanx to the Bahamut SSL patch by Rossi Marcello.
      ClientSSL is enabled by default and must be disabled using --disable-openssl while running ./configure
      if you do not have SSL availible. You can also specify an alternate source for the SSL library using
      --enable-openssl=PATH
      To set a port as to accept SSL connections you use the following PLine syntax:
      P:ip range to allow:ip to bind to:SSL:port
 (SM) Removed the GNU MP dependency for server <-> server encryption. Now depends on OpenSSL
      instead. Patch taken from Bahamut-devel. aka OpenSSL ala Lucas.     
 (SM) Completely reworked /USERHOST. It now will correctly return NOSUCHNICK for bad nicknames and will NOT return
      empty 302 replies. It also now returns Realhostself since some clients depend on this.
      It also returns WHOISHOST for IRC Operators.
      Reported by Virus @ Novernet
 (SM) Cosmetical changes to certain WHOIS reply's to make them more easilly parseable by clients and scripts.
 (SM) /MODE no longer allows modefloods with multiple +/-k and +/-l on channels.

 (SM) Cosmetical fixes to several error replies dealing with channels.
      Reported by JH @ irc-chat.net
 (SM) Fixed a bug that could lead to users being able to join keyed channels with invalid keys.
 (SM) Fixed several bugs related to WATCH's hash table.
 (SM) Fixed several bugs in NICK's checks related to if oldnick was the same as newnick.
 (SM) Fixed several other similiar bugs while auditing the use of irccmp (formerly mycmp).
 (SM) renamed irccmp to irccmp_lex and rewrote irccmp and ircncmp as most things in IRCd
      does indeed not use lexiographical checking.
 (SM) Borrowed hybrid7's match() and collapse() as they are much more cleanly done and more
      efficient from what i can tell than the old bahamut equivalents.
 (BP) Profiling fixes.
 (SM) Hybrid style drone protection added. Ported from Hybrid 6 stable tree.
 (BP) Complete rewrite of the kline/akill/zline system. (s)zlines no longer exist.

 (BP) Source address support on /connect problem fixed.
 (BP) Moved rejection notices to umode +j (re_j_ection).
 (SM) E and F lines should now work fully.
      E lines exempt from K and G lines (Z lines no longer exsist) and throttles.
      F lines exempt from user limits.
      It is highly recomended to keep the list of E and F lines short.
      E lines have to be set on *@IP in order to work against Throttles and kill lines in the form
      of *@IP or IP.
 (SM) ChannelModes aohv was NOT listed as a supported channel mode during connection which breaks
      clients depending on it like IRCLE.
      Reported by (Onno at ircle dot com)
 (SM) More cosmetical fixes to WHO and USERHOST realhost replies.
 (SM) Fixed /INVITE so you can actually invite users into +S, +R and +A channels as intended.
 (SM) Cleaned up /JOIN handeling for +R channels.
 (SM) Fixed a bug causing IRC Services using the bahamut protocol to not see SJOIN's.
      Reported by Delta_5 @ SRC Forums.

      Reported by Delta_5 @ SRC Forums.
 (SM) /STATS c/C are now fully oper only and will display IP's to administrators.
 (SM) /SILENCE now matches against hiddenhosts correctly.
      Reported by Mortalica.
 (SM) OLine flags have been updated. Several old flags have been removed as they served no real
      purpose in restriction and the TechAdmin and TechCoAdmin flags have been added.
      See the ircd.conf.dist or doc/olineflags for more info.
 (SM) NO_CHANOPS_WHEN_SPLIT and REJECT_ACEBOTS are now controlled by ./config
 (SM) Made the rejection notice for ACEBOTS more usefull for real clients.
      Suggested by Noam.


alpha26
 (SM) Server will now send out the correct error string when you cannot join a channel when you are
      banned, trying to join an invite only channel etc.
 (SM) ! is now used for Channel Administrators since someone quite correctly pointed out that
       was in the extended ascii range and would not work as intended on all systems.
 (SM) 'I' is now used in /who to designate a user who is invisible. (Oper only)
 (SM) = is now used in /names and /whois to designate a user or channel which you would not see
      if you where a normal user. (Oper only)
 (SM) FMODE now also sends a notice to channel staff that fmode have been used to further deter abuse.
 (SM) FMODE and FJOIN now sends netglobal notices instead of global and netinfo.


alpha25
 (AA) The kill notice contains now the full serverpath
 (AA) Fixed the /ADDOPER /DELOPER commands .. they didnt work correct

      reconnct you may be banned. But it will help you to survive a wrong kline.
 (BP) Fixes from Bahamut-release tree.
 (SM) Channel Administrators are now prefixed with  and will be correcly displayed in /WHO and elsewhere.
 (SM) /WHO tokens have been altered slightly.
      <*> % now designates a HalfOp
      <*>  now designates a user set +i. Only seen by IRC Operators.
 (SM) SSJOIN now at protocol level 4 to deal with the change in Channel Administrators prefix change.
      Limited backwards compactibility added but will be removed before b1 is released.
 (SM) Idle time for operators now show i /whois again.
 (SM) /WHOIS have undergone some cosmetical alterations.
 (SM) Hunted down and killed the stupid(tm) error causing problems in alpha23 causing the recall.
 (SM) Reversed read_message() patch from a24 as it caused preformance problems.
 (SM) E lines now exempt from K/G/Z lines aswell as throttles.
 (SM) Please note that E and F lines are not yet fully finalized and some bugs may remain.
      Also note that some services may enforce AKILLS, SZLINES and SGLINES and thus
      kill users regardless of E lines.


alpha24
 (SM) Notices about users carrying invitations overriding bans now are sent to all channel staff.
      Reported by Anomy
 (SM) Removed asserts from irccmp() and ircncmp()
 (SM) Call read_message() with a delay of 1 for servers aswell. This is at least a workaround for
      the issue discovered in a23. Thanx to Shmad for helping out debugging.


alpha23
 (AA) Ported /ADDCNLINE, /ADDULINE, /ADDQLINE, /ADDHLINE and /ADDOPER
      from Uircd 2.8.2. And the counterparts with /DEL*

 (BP) Fixed a server negotiation bug that could break apart the network
      when autoconnects and user connects were done at the same instant
 (BP) Fix a bug where PART messages were not sent to 'userB' when 'userA's
      QUIT message was squelched on more than 1 channel
 (BP) Keep /trace from crashing and/or trashing on memory
 (SM) Fixed a cosmetical issue with the link routing notices for non NickIP servers.
 (SM) NICK's introduced with invalid number of parameters aswell as NICK's introduced with invalid hostnames
     (ie. hostnames without a single dot) will no longer only be ignored, but also killed to prevent desynchs.
 (SM) Reverted the partial RFC violation fix introduced in a22 after having discussed it some more.
      The fix was only partial and didnt work properly. Taking into consideration that most IRCds now no longer
      aknowledges that part of the RFC, we reverted back to ascii matching.
 (SM) IRCd socks4 proxy scanner is now disabled by default and is listed in the broken/discouraged section of
      include/config.h
      The UltimateIRCd development team strongly recomends that 3rd party tools like bopm or neobopm be used
      for the task.

alpha22
 <*> Upgraded to zlib1.1.4-p1
     Thanx to Mark Adler <madler at alumni do caltech dot edu> and Jean-loup Gailly <jloup at gzip dot org> for hunting down
     the obscure bug causing crashes. Turns out to be a bug in gcc with -O.
 <*> Multiple channels in OPERS_AUTO_JOIN or USERS_AUTO_JOIN will actually work past the first
     connecting client or first /oper.
 <*> GEO_LOCATION now outputted in RPL_CREATED instead of RPL_YOURHOST.
 <*> Cosmetical change to RPL_CREATED. "This server was created" is now "This server was last (re)started on".
 <*> /who now returns * for IRC Operators __everywhere__, reported by Anomy.
 <*> Fix a DALnet RFC violation in handeling of nicknames and channels. {}|^ are to be considered the lowercase
     equivalent of []\~. Bahamut's failure to abide by this breaks IRC clients which abides by the RFC aswell as
     create confusion for scandinavian users as for example #H�on wont be the same channel as #H�ON even though
     its not different from say #Dreamer and #DREAMER.
 <*> Fixed a bug in channel_mode which could lead to very bad things(tm) happening.
     Reported by X-Trace.

     the key would become 10 and not somekey.
 <*> Clients introduced from other servers that have no . (dot) in their hostname are now correctly ignored.
 <*> It is no longer possible to split ride a new topic to already exsisting channels, fix from bahamut-devel.

 <*> Halfops cannot invite to +i/+N/+O channels anymore.
 <*> Fixed a bahamut bug(tm) in akill and szline where not all clients where checked against the newly added
     akills/szlines. Thus some clients who should have been killed was not under rare circumstances.
 <*> When adding SZlines and SGlines the IRCd now checks if it have any clients matching the respective
     SZlines and SGlines.
 <*> /Who flag changes introduced in alpha19 have been reversed.
      * - User is an IRC Operator
      % - User is invisible (Oper only)

      (for no_chanops_when_split)
     - Fix for .conf based K: lines (that just didn't work)
     - Kline/akill/zline matching has been revamped, which should help greatly with
      lag under heavy user loads with many klines/akills/zlines

       the spreading of exploits
     - Q Line reason will now show when trying to join a Q lined channel.
     - Klines are now matched against IP's aswell.
