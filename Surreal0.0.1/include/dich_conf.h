/*
 * The dich_conf.h and dich_conf.c were written to provide a generic
 * interface for configuration lines matching. I decided to write it
 * after I read Roy's K: line tree patch. the underlying ideas are the
 * following : . get rid of the left/right branches by using a
 * dichotomy on an ordered list . arrange patterns matching one another
 * in a tree so that if we find a possible match, all other possible
 * matches are "below" These routines are meant for fast matching.
 * There is no notion of "best" of "first" (meaning the order in which
 * the lines are read) match. Therefore, the following functions are
 * fit for K: lines matching but not I: lines matching (as sad as it
 * may be). Other kinds of configuration lines aren't as time consuming
 * or just aren't use for matching so it's irrelevant to try and use
 * these functions for anything else. However, I still made them as
 * generic as possible, just in case.
