# This file allows you to set V Lines for users so they can use
# the /VHOST command and have a special hiddenhost set on themselves.
#
# V Lines should be in the following format always:
#
# V:virtualhost:password:username
# 
# Only one V line per username is adviseable or you might run into
# unwanted problems.
#
# Please note that V Line passwords are currently set to ENCRYPTED
# by default.
