Installing UltimateIRCD 3.0.0
==============================

All commands should be issued from the IRCd root directory
unless otherwise stated.

1) Issue: "./configure" (issue "./configure --help" for a full list of supported options)
2) Issue: "make", in the event of errors (warnings can normally be ignored)
   please consult the FAQ or check the support forums at http://www.shadow-realm.org/
3) Issue: "make install"
4) move to your installation directory, ~/Ultimate by default.
5) Edit etc/ircd.ini and create the file etc/ircd.conf from etc/ircd.conf.dist
6) Optionally edit the etc/networks/temple.network to your liking.
7) If you are setting up the IRCd with SSL enabled ports and do not have a SSL certificate,
    you will need to enter the bin/ directory and run the ./ssl-cert.sh script.
    This step will create a SELF SIGNED SSL certificate.
8) Run the ircd by using the ./ircd script or by launching the binary directly
   by bin/ircd. In case of problems, read the FAQ
