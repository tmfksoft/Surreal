1.2 CREDITS
-----------

SurrealIRCD  has been forked and is maintained by Thomas Edwards and is
Copyright (C) 2013 by the past and present ircd coders, and others.
SurrealIRCD is based upon UltimateIRCd which was based on the Bahamut IRCd written for DALnet.

Refer to the documentation in doc/authors/ for full credits and copyrights.


1.3 INTRODUCTION
----------------

    UltimateIRCd started out as a very small project back in late
1997 called WorldVillageIRCd when i was offered the opportunity
to maintain the server software for Infomedia Inc's chat site which
was a part of WorldVillage (http//www.WorldVillage.com/)
It started out life using DAL4.4.17 as a base, and back then i
didnt know a single line of the C programming language.

    As time passed by other IRCd's code was used as a base for
functions and changes made to the first early versions of
WorldVillageIRCd. Not long after DALnet released DreamForge to the
public and WorldVillageIRCd was recoded, and by that time i had
started to gain some basic C knowledge to make some real changes
to the code instead of simple editing of the s_err.c file =)

    Not to long after the first recode the network was renamed to
UltimateIRC.net and it was decided to again recode the IRCd from
scratch and rename it to UltimateIRCd. The versions up until 2.5.x
was all internal and most archives of the older versions have been
lost along with any changelog since this was never intended released
to the public. Using EliteIRCd, UnrealIRCd, Austhex and IRCu as
sources for inspiration and in many cases also using whole functions
from them Ultimate started to become somewhat a decent IRCd with
usefull features and as time went by more and more people began
asking me if they could have the source for the IRCd. I decided to
release the IRCd to the public and it quickly drew lots of interest.
The late versions of the 2.7.x was rewarded with a 5 penguin rating
at Tucows (http://www.Tucows.com/) and also recived a
"Best of linux award" at Dave Central (http://www.DaveCentral.com/)

    In november of 2000 i decided to do a recode of the IRCd which
had grown quite buggy over the past two years mostly due to my own
limited coding skills. Bahamut1.4.8 was choosen as the most suitable
base since it relied on a more advanced protocol than the old
DreamForge and much more efficient.

    In later years more and more people have gained an interest in
the IRCd and many others have added their code and work to this IRCd
in one way or another. UltimateIRCd would not be where it is today without
the help and dedication of the community surrounding UltimateIRCd.

8.1 IRC SERVICES
----------------

    One of the most common questions asked about IRCd's are what
services should i use with this IRCd. When it comes to services
there are just as many flavours as there are IRCd's so the best
advice i can give is to try out the different services packages and
decide for yourself.

	Please note:
	When using IRC Services with SurrealIRCD please select the UltimateIRCD protocol.
	Do not bother asking the IRCD Services to support SurrealIRCD due to the project
	being a direct fork of UltimateIRCD.
