If you don't read this first, we won't help you.

See the INSTALL document for info on configuring and compiling
UltimateIRCd 3.0

See the FAQ for frequently asked questions. If you do NOT read the FAQ
and come ask for support on something answered by the FAQ, chances are
you quite rudly will be told to read the FAQ. The FAQ is there to prevent
having to repeatedly and pointlessly answer Frequently Asked Questions.
Hence its name.

DEBUGGING MODE: if you run ircd with src/ircd -s , it will send
errors that are normally syslogged to stderr.  This is very useful
if you don't have syslogging set up and ircd won't run.

IMPORTANT. If upgrading from 2.8.x or previous you will need to
recreate your networks settings file and ircd.ini file.

ZLines NO LONGER EXSIST. A Kline set on K:ip:reason:* now serves the same
function as an szline.
SZLines are also no longer supported, but akills serve the same function when set
on *@ip

The format of P lines have changed and O line flags have been altered.

U and H lines have been altered. 
**** YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR U AND H LINES ****

U:Server Name:*:*::
H:servers which are permitted entry::hub server::

See example.conf or ircd.conf.dist for examples or more info.

TRANSLATION: You *MUST* fix your conf before upgrading from older versions.

The network settings files will change between releases during the alpha versions.
Be sure to keep an eye on conf/networks/ChangeLog and adjust your network settings file
accordingly.
