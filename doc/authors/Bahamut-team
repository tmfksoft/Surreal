Bahamut was taken on by a group of loosely nit coders that decided that
Dreamforge just was eating up too much CPU to handle DALnet's growing user
base.  Originally starting out as the DFhybrid project, it slowly grew
into the Bahamut project as the peices started falling together.

Bahamut is based upon the hybrid IRCd, developed for EFnet, and we most
surely wouldn't be where we are today without the dedication of the coders
that developed that IRCd.  The Hybrid team is outlined in the file
included with this distribution, in docs/Hybrid-team.  Please look over
that file, those people are as much to credit for this as the people
listed here.

People who have supported the Bahamut project with code, support, or
testing are, in alphabetical order:

Aaron Wiebe         epiphani@solarz.net
Chip Norkus         wd@dal.net
David Friedman      driz@dal.net
David Knepper       dakal@dal.net
