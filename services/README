If you are using a Services Package that at one point did support UltimateIRCD but has removed
support due to the UltimateIRCD Project dying off. You can find the appropriate files in this
directory. Just move the .c file for the correct Services Package to the protocl/protocol directory
for your services package and name it surrealircd.c Do the same for the header files (*.h)
